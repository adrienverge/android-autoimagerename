Auto Image Rename
=================

This is an Android app to automatically and periodically rename image files in a
user-defined directory, e.g. from ``20221202_200100.jpg`` to
``IMG_20221202_200100.jpg``.

It is comparable to the app `DSC Auto Rename`_, which does not work anymore on
Android 11 and further.
